You can adjust your customer projects with changes necessary to use the library you provide. Apart from that, Schematics is a great tool for enterprise, which needs to maintain UI elements on behalf of multiple dev-teams.</p><p>In this talk, I am going to start from a high-overview of schematics framework, used by Angular CLI. Audience would get familiar with the Tree and Rule objects concept. I want to show a working example of create, read, update and delete operations, performed by schematics, how can you make  use of TypeScript compiler and how to send a task like package installation to NodeJS.</p><p>What will be covered here, are ‚ng add’, ‚ng update’, ’ng new’, ‚ng generate’ etc. etc. commands, together with best practices, how to perform a unit tests, and end-to-end tests with the use of tools like mock npm registry.</p>",
